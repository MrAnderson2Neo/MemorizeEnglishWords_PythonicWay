We have been waiting for this day. We hope the remaining girls will soon be released." It was unclear whether his daughters had been freed.A military source told the agency the freed girls would be flown to Borno's state capital of Maiduguri on Sunday.The campaign for the return of the girls drew the support of then US First Lady Michelle Obama and many Hollywood stars.Last month, President Muhammadu Buhari said the government remained "in constant touch through negotiations, through local intelligence to secure the release of the remaining girls and other abducted persons unharmed".Many of the Chibok girls were Christian, but were encouraged to convert to Islam and to marry their kidnappers during their time in captivity.Boko Haram has kidnapped thousands of other people during its eight-year insurgency aimed at creating an Islamic caliphate in north-eastern Nigeria.More than 30,000 others have been killed, the government says, and hundreds of thousands have been forced to flee from their homes.The abduction of 276 girls in 2014 sparked a global outcry and the #BringBackOurGirls campaign.  It was a well-meaning campaign to address bullying, but it ended in a passionate row over "tolerance".

                        This week, former Blackburn striker Chris Sutton said Mourinho was "humiliating" his players by querying their dedication to the Red Devils.Wenger added: "Ideally you have to be careful with that because you cannot do that in every single game. "You can do that in extreme situations but it has to be handled carefully because it just makes that stress level worse for them. Top players have a good and objective assessment. They know well where they stand."You cannot always say to the players 'we are all in the same boat and in this together to achieve something' and then you jump out of the boat and say, 'it's your fault now', but when it goes well you take the credit. "You are in a position where you have to be part of it and fight for them when it doesn't go well, you have to control what you say." United go into the game five points ahead of sixth-placed Arsenal, having played a game more, but are four points adrift of rivals Liverpool who are in fourth position.BBC Sport's Simon Stone:Manchester United winger Ashley Young has been ruled out of the game at Arsenal with a hamstring injury. Young, 31, was injured after coming on as a substitute in the Europa League semi-final win over Celta Vigo on Thursday.It is not known exactly how long Young will be out for but there are fears he could be sidelined for the rest of the season.United manager Mourinho has threatened to play youngsters at the Emirates Stadium after deciding to prioritise his side's European campaign.Four players yet to make a first-team appearance have been included in his travelling squad for tomorrow's game.Matty Willock and Scott McTominay have been included in recent United squads. They have travelled to London, along with 20-year-old England Schoolboys winger Demetri Mitchell and teenage USA Under-19 international defender Matt Olosunde.Arsenal could be without midfielder Granit Xhaka who has a calf problem, but defender Shkodran Mustafi could play after returning from a back injury.Share this withGet latest scores and headlines sent straight to your phone, sign-up to our newsletter and learn where to find us on online.The latest rumours and stories from around the world of football.Enjoy the best debate, analysis and interviews with 5 live and World Service football plus our commentary listings.How to get into football - the most popular sport in the world, with clubs and facilities throughout the UK.England��s 500-year-old angel roofs are striking �C and all but unknown. Michael Rimmer��s photographs provide a rare chance to encounter their beauty up close.  (Credit: Michael Rimmer)But the roofs remain seen by few; even those who visit the churches don��t always catch their details. ��Distance and lighting make it hard to appreciate the detail of angel roofs with the naked eye, or even with binoculars. Were they as accessible and visible as, say, the Renaissance paintings in Italian churches, I think the best of them would be just as highly celebrated,�� Rimmer writes. (Credit: Michael Rimmer)(Credit: Michael Rimmer)The angels at Westminster Hall aren��t just decorative. Projecting out from the walls, they support vertical hammer posts and help hold up the entire roof structure, which is no mean feat: the roof��s oak alone weighs some 600 tons. With each angel carrying the King��s arms, the figures also enforce Richard II��s claim to absolute power; as Rimmer notes, ��he was the first king to insist on the title ��Royal Majesty�� and to require courtiers to bend the knee��.Within a couple of decades, similar angel roofs were springing up across England, particularly in East Anglia. That may be because the Westminster Hall architect moved from that project to one in Norfolk, spreading the idea (and his expertise) among others in the region, which includes Norfolk, Suffolk and Cambridgeshire. (Credit: Michael Rimmer)(Credit: Michael Rimmer)��The English Reformation was not just a religious revolution. It was an artistic holocaust,�� says Rimmer.angel roofsAt the church of St Mary in Woolpit, Suffolk, nearly all the 66 angels decorating its hammerbeam roof were destroyed. They were replaced by restorations.(Credit: Michael Rimmer)As a result, the roof angels today aren��t just pretty decorations. When most of England��s 9,000 medieval churches today lack the art, stained glass and statues they once would have contained, the cherubim are among the few remaining, tantalising glimpses of what England��s medieval churches would have looked like. (Credit: Michael Rimmer)Part of the reason angel roofs go mostly unnoticed is that it��s hard to appreciate any of their details. Not only are the roofs high above our heads, making them uncomfortable (and difficult) to see, but the light in the churches is often low, making it hard to pick out their decorations. ��This is where photography has a particular advantage,�� Rimmer notes �C a camera can both zoom in, and, unlike the human eye, use a longer exposure to brighten up the details. (Credit: Michael Rimmer)St Peter MancroftOne of the finest places to admire angel roofs is Norwich, which lies about 100 miles northeast of London. England��s second-largest city in the 15th Century, Norwich has no fewer than five angel roofs. St Peter Mancroft, which dates to between 1430 and 1455, is one of them.

Nothing will go without a response."He did not elaborate, but Mr Macron's team has already been the victim of attacks which it blames on groups based in Russia and Ukraine, and last year's US election campaign was also the subject of hacking attacks targeting the Democratic Party.Mr Hollande added that he could not say whether the attack was an attempt to destabilise the election.The BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris says the impact of the hacking attack on the vote is unlikely to be significant, as Mr Macron enjoyed a wide lead in opinion polls that were taken before campaigning ended.It is part of the restrictions that came into force at midnight local time on Friday.

About nine gigabytes of data were posted by an anonymous user.Mr Macron's En Marche movement said internal campaign documents, including emails and financial data, had been taken in an "act of massive, co-ordinated hacking"."The leaked files were obtained several weeks ago by hacking personal and professional email accounts of several officials of the movement," it said in a statement.The hashtag #MacronLeaks appeared on Twitter on an account used by a US alt-right figure on Friday afternoon - and was reportedly retweeted 87 times in the first five minutes, suggesting the use of automated bots to spread the information faster.Within 90 minutes, the information had caught the attention of prominent supporters of Marine Le Pen and was further spread by bots.Some three-and-a-half hours after the initial tweet, #MacronLeaks had been used some 47,000 times and the prominent Wikileaks account played a key role in publicising the hashtag.Unclear. The Macron camp has not blamed any specific party but said the hack clearly aimed to damage it and undermine French democracy,It compared it to the leak of Democratic Party emails in last year's US presidential election that was blamed on Russian hackers.Wikileaks, which published those emails, posted a link to the Macron documents on Twitter but implied it was not responsible.Please enable Javascript to view our poll of polls chart.Macron campaign servers went down for several minutes in February after attacks apparently originating in Ukraine.Mr Macron's team said it suspected the Kremlin of wanting to help Ms Le Pen, who supports a pro-Moscow foreign policy.Russia has denied that it is behind attacks aimed at Mr Macron.France's voters have rejected the two big political parties - the Socialists and the Republicans - that have governed for decades.Voters will be making a decision on France's future direction and on its place at the heart of the European Union. If they opt for liberal Emmanuel Macron, they will be backing a candidate who seeks EU reform as well as deeper European integration, in the form of a eurozone budget and eurozone finance ministers. If instead they choose far-right Marine Le Pen she promises quite the opposite.

Mist clings to the tree tops in a heavily-wooded area, just south of Rouen. Among the trees, a man-made clearing is populated by workmen in fluorescent vests. They make up the team from the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims Remains. For the past week, they've been clearing away trees, saplings and undergrowth in the search for Seamus Ruddy. Now it seems that search has reached a conclusion with the discovery of human remains. The 50 sq kms of forest are home to an array of wildlife, with deer and wild boar roaming freely. During the hunting season, the usually quiet remoteness of this part of Normandy is shattered by the sound of gunfire. In May 1985, nobody heard the shot that killed Seamus Ruddy except those who murdered him. His body was buried in the flinty soil and left there. The Newry-born teacher who had been working in Paris when he disappeared, was murdered by the INLA. He became one of a group known as the "Disappeared". For 32 years, his family has been trying to locate his body to bring him home for a Christian burial. Today, under a rain-soaked tent, what could be his remains may mark the end of that sorrowful quest.Mr Ruddy's sister, Anne Morgan, was the last member of his family to see the County Down teacher alive.  She visited the scene on Friday. It is understood she has been informed about the discovery.This latest search began in a forest at Pont-de-l'Arche after new information on the whereabouts of Mr Ruddy was passed to the ICLVR from the Irish Republican Socialist Party (IRSP) and former INLA members.The group has close links to the INLA. Sources in the IRSP claim Mr Ruddy went willingly with INLA members from Paris to the wooded area, where there was an arms dump. What happened among the group is not clear but Mr Ruddy was shot dead. He was buried in a shallow grave. Sources claim that INLA members returned to the spot the following day, removed the arms cache and buried Mr Ruddy where it had been.  It is understood that former INLA and IRSP members travelled to northern France last year to try to pinpoint the spot where the Newry man was buried.Mr Ruddy's sister, Anne Morgan, has said she knows the names of the people who killed her brother. Mr Ruddy was one of four people out of 16 Disappeared whose bodies had not been found.The others are Columba McVeigh, Joe Lynskey and Army Capt Robert Nairac.The abduction of 276 girls in 2014 sparked a global outcry and the #BringBackOurGirls campaign.

If they win both games they will stay up.Palace's final match of the season is at Manchester United, who are unbeaten in their past 24 league games.For the Swans, a passionate fanbase turned into a delirious one before a ball was even kicked in south Wales, after Sunderland's victory over Hull.That lifted a boisterous Liberty Stadium, but it took almost half an hour before Swansea created a big opportunity in a cagey contest.When they did, they took it expertly, Llorente heading home from close range after Ayew's twisting run and deflected cross fell perfectly.Holgate then produced an outstanding challenge to deny Mawson, with a Jagielka block also denying Martin Olsson's effort from an acute angle.Swansea continued to carve out the better chances, Ayew's volley with the outside of his foot hitting the post, and it was not until the 66th minute that Lukasz Fabianski was seriously tested by Lukaku's 20-yard shot.The hosts spurned further chances through Llorente and Fer. It might have cost Swansea at the death when their former skipper Ashley Williams was inches away from heading home, but he couldn't quite convert from Kevin Mirallas' flick-on.

                        Everton stay seventh, two points behind sixth-placed Arsenal but having played three games more than the Gunners.The Toffees have the feel of a club already building for next term.Ross Barkley, whose future in unclear as his contract runs down, was dropped by Ronald Koeman as was loanee Enner Valencia.Barkley's introduction at half-time was evidence that Everton had lacked panache in the final third, with Fabianski entirely untroubled before the break.Everton had won eight of their past 11 visits to Swansea, but not even returning Wales captain Williams - whose every touch was jeered by a section of the home fans - could inspire the visitors.

                        "We have hit some form both offensively and especially defensively. We have played against really good opposition and seven points from three games is a fantastic tally."It gave us a lift before the game knowing that result had gone in our favour, we knew if we did something special we could get out of the relegation zone."We really defended well.""The final part, we had to be a little bit more aggressive in the box. The problem is in the last few weeks to create chances - we don't score in the last three games."In my opinion, seventh position is a good position and next Friday is important to give the fans a win they deserve."Swansea visit relegated Sunderland in their penultimate match of the season on Saturday, 13 May (15:00 BST), while Everton host 15th-placed Watford next Friday (19:45 BST).Match ends, Swansea City 1, Everton 0.Second Half ends, Swansea City 1, Everton 0.Attempt saved.

The manager of the company that ran the landfill site and the former head of Shenzhen's administration bureau were jailed for 20 years.Nearly 20 of those sentenced were government officials.They were convicted of negligence and abuse of power.The dump site had a storage capacity of four million cubic metres and a maximum stacking height of 95m (310 ft) but when the landslide happened it was holding 5.8m cubic metres of material and the waste heaps stood 160m high, Xinhua reported.The landslide covered an area the size of 50 football pitches and more than 200 diggers were brought in to clear the slurry.A week later one official, whose job involved regulating construction sites and who had authorised the landfill site, apparently jumped to his death. It is not clear if he was under investigation.The abduction of 276 girls in 2014 sparked a global outcry and the #BringBackOurGirls campaign.

The CIA declined to comment and South Korea has issued no statement so far.The North's claim comes amid continued high tension on the Korean peninsula.US President Donald Trump has promised to "solve" North Korea and stop it developing nuclear weapons.Full text of North's allegationThe statement should be treated with scepticism. The regime has a track record of false information. It would be surprising if American or South Korean intelligence agencies didn't try to have agents in North Korea but the specific allegations about an assassination plot raise many questions.Why hasn't a suspect been produced? Why does the KCNA statement cite poisoning at one moment and a bombing the next? How would anyone get access to Kim Jong-un, a man perpetually surrounded by squads of protectors and whose movements are secret?Journalists who go to Pyongyang have cell-phones taken off them whenever they go to events where he might be, presumably to prevent tracking - so how would an ordinary citizen get more access?Plots to kill Kim Jong-un may have been hatched but a bald statement by the media controlled by a vicious regime does not add up to convincing evidence.The ministry of state security statement, carried by state news agency KCNA, said the CIA and South Korean intelligence services had "hatched a vicious plot to hurt the supreme leadership of the DPRK".It did not mention Kim Jong-un by name, but he is widely referred to as the supreme leader.The ministry said a plot had been hatched to use "bomb terrorism" to target the supreme leadership at a military parade or at an event at the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, the mausoleum of Kim Il-sung, the country's founding leader.It said "Kim" had been told that the best method was the use of "biochemical substances including radioactive substance and nano poisonous substance" whose results would "appear after six or 12 months".Source: Ministry of state security statement via KCNAFull text of North's allegation"Only the CIA can produce such substance", it said, adding that South Korea had borne the funding.The ministry alleged that the North Korean man had been "turned" by the CIA and the South Korean intelligence service while working in Russia in 2014.On his return to Pyongyang, it says, he was instructed to provide detailed information about a frequently used event ground and to assess possible methods of attack.What's changed between US and N Korea?Trump: I would meet Kim Jong-unNorth Korea crisis: Your questions answeredThe ministry statement gave no details of how the alleged plan had been uncovered or about the fate of "Kim", whom it described as "human scum".The ministry said the "intelligence and plot-breeding organisations of the US imperialists and the puppet clique", referring to the South, would be swept away.Earlier this year, Kim Jong-un's half brother, Kim Jong-nam, was killed with the banned nerve agent VX at Kuala Lumpur international airport. South Korea and Malaysia say it was an assassination carried out by the North.A war of words between the West and nuclear-armed North Korea has escalated in recent weeks, with Pyongyang threatening to carry out a sixth nuclear test.On Saturday, North Korea conducted its second failed ballistic missile test in two weeks.The US has sent a warship to the region and installed a controversial anti-missile defence system in South Korea.President Trump has warned of "major, major conflict" with North Korea.But he also said this week he would be willing to meet Kim Jong-un, in the right circumstances. The White House quickly clarified that conditions were "clearly not there right now" and said the North should "end its provocative behaviour immediately".The abduction of 276 girls in 2014 sparked a global outcry and the #BringBackOurGirls campaign.

A senior official in Kandahar said the Pakistani team had been counting people on the Afghan side of the border. The two nations are divided by a porous border drawn by the British and disputed by Afghanistan. The clash happened in Luqman and Jahangir, villages straddling the border.A clash on this scale is rare. But ties between the two nations are tense - they accuse each other of failing to tackle militants on their soil. Earlier this year, Pakistan shut border crossings after a spate of attacks it blamed on militants from over the border.In a statement, Pakistan's military said that Afghan authorities had been informed in advance about the census work. It accused Afghan border police of "creating hurdles" for the census. But Samim Khpalwak, a spokesman for the governor of Kandahar province, said the Pakistani team had strayed across the border. A spokesman for Kandahar police told Reuters news agency that the Pakistani team were using the census as cover for ""malicious activities and to provoke villagers against the government".At least two Afghan border police are reported to have been hurt. Skirmishes on Pakistan's border with Afghanistan have not been as frequent as on its eastern border with India but there have been occasional firefights, mostly due to a disputed border. The border, called the Durand Line, virtually disappeared during the 1980s when Pakistan-based militant groups fought a decade-long war against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. Since 2007, when some groups spawned by Pakistan-based militant networks turned hostile towards Islamabad, Pakistan has made efforts to firm up its border vigilance. This has caused several fatalities on both sides of the border.In February this year, Pakistani troops resorted to heavy shelling of Afghan territory in Nangarhar region, saying the area was hosting anti-Pakistan militants. Afghan officials reported several deaths on their side and the dislocation of people from villages close to the border. The Pakistani move came after the bombing of a Sufi shrine in southern Pakistan in which over 80 people were killed.

To save Scottish wildcats from extinction, a few conservationists are leaving them aloneThe Sun is rising on a calm and cloudy morning in late February 2017, and Jamie Sneddon and I have an important collection to make. After a short drive along the north-east coast of Scotland �C passing open fields, detached bungalows, and blooming bushes of gorse that shine with a radiant yellow under the grey sky �C we arrive at the muddy entrance of a farmyard.Many of the locals here in the remote Scottish Highlands are crofters: they nurture and trade certain root vegetables and small numbers of livestock and poultry, a lifestyle first developed in the 19th Century. After opening a red and rusting gate, we disturb a vocal gaggle of geese and a few chickens. Through the wire fences that border the farm, we can also see a small flock of sheep.However, Sneddon has only one animal on his mind: a cat. He is hoping to catch a stray tomcat that rules the yard. The previous day, he had baited a small cage inside one of the farm's stone outbuildings with mackerel �C cheap, smelly, and easy to split into portions �C and cat food.This media cannot be played on your device.London and surrounds offer an irresistible cacophony of nightlife, food and drink, natural wonders and world-leading culture for you to check out. We��ve delved into London and its neighbouring cities of Brighton, Bristol, Liverpool and Manchester �C all within approximately 2 hours �C to unlock their best-kept secrets.Click here to Unlock BritainIt worked. After noticing the trap door had shut during the night, the landowner placed a 12-pack of ale on the metal cage, both as a gift for Sneddon and as a weight for added security. Peering into the cage in the morning, we can see that this was a wise precaution. The black-and-white tomcat is huge, thick at the shoulders with muscle, and he has the classic widened face that only develops in sexually-mature males. His nose is covered in claw marks. This is his turf �C his farm, his females �C and he has been fighting for it.Luckily for Sneddon, the cat seems tired out and remains somewhat somnolent as he carries the cage to the boot of the car. I carry the box of beers, a much lighter cargo than the big tom.But the cat is the true gift. Over the next few hours, he transforms from an aggressive stray into a treasured tool of conservation. Ultimately, it could help to protect one of the rarest creatures on Earth: the Scottish wildcat.In the hills, fields, and gullies surrounding the farm, the isolated populations of Scottish wildcats are within walking distance. The life of this tomcat is the story of their future survival.Nobody knows when wildcats first moved to Britain. But they became permanent residents around 6,500 years ago when the Earth warmed, the ice melted and the North Sea swept back over Doggerland.Britain was an island once more, and the wildcats that had crossed Doggerland were cut off from their relatives in Europe. Over generations, they evolved thick grey stripes that run down their flanks and encircle their broad tail, camouflaging their presence in Scottish pine forests.Around the same time, however, researchers were realising that they had a lot more work to do. It had become apparent that the biggest threat to wildcats was not humans, but their pets.Pet cats are more numerous than any other cat species. They were introduced to Britain by the Normans in the 11th Century, and perhaps by the Romans much earlier. In Scotland, there are nearly 200,000 stray domestic cats, which often stay close to human habitations. (Feral cats that are completely independent of humans are rare in at these northerly, bitter latitudes.)Slowly, with each hybrid litter, Scottish wildcats are being domesticated, diluted into a form that strains the definition of "wild". Instead of hunting alone in the wilderness, they often hunt from garden bird feeders, devastating the local populations of rare birds.It is possible that this hybridisation started 2,000 years ago. For that reason, some researchers believe that no wildcat is truly wild anymore. All are hybridised �C domesticated �C to a degree. This idea has been supported by genetic tests that found domestic DNA in old wildcat specimens.But there are still a few wildcats that are boldly striped, that eschew all contact with people, and that hunt hares, rabbits, and other small mammals over large tracts of the Scottish highlands.These are the cats that Sneddon and his colleagues hope to save. To do so, they leave them alone. They touch not the cat.The Wildcat Haven team has a motto of their own: "Keeping wildcats in the wild where they belong." As Sneddon and I drive around the meandering roads near Wick and Thurso in north-east Scotland, this is written on our car's front doors, underneath a logo of a wildcat formed entirely from black and grey stripes. Seeing this image as we drive past might be the closest many people will get to a true wildcat.After collecting the big tomcat, Sneddon and I visit many other landowners, all of whom feed stray cats in return for keeping the mouse and rat populations in their barns down. Such "mousing" is a symbiotic relationship, but it can also be harmful for the cats. Living in human barns and outbuildings also means living with roads and cars; I see plenty of dead cats in the roadside mud. What's more, inside the buildings domestic cats can live in large colonies numbering over 50 individuals, which become breeding grounds for disease."It's a paradoxical project," Ewan Brennan, volunteer field biologist for Wildcat Haven, says later. "To save wildcats, we work almost exclusively with domestics."After the morning farm rounds, we drive the black-and-white tomcat to a nearby rented veterinary clinic. The first step is a quick injection with an anaesthetic mixed with painkillers. He does not seem to notice anything at all, his green eyes unblinking. "Strays don't flinch," says Nick Morphet, the senior field vet for Wildcat Haven and the man holding the needle. "They've had a hard life."In five minutes, the big tom is fast asleep and can be carried safely to the operating table. It is not an easy task: he weighs about 5.5kg, nearly as big as domestic cats get. "Oh yeah, he's a bruiser isn't he," says the veterinary nurse, rubbing his flanks for any sign of injury. She feels something that might indicate a damaged organ, but Morphet thinks it is just a lumpy rib. And straightaway, Lumpy Rib joins the other notable stray names, including Scrapyard Cat, Alley Cat and the enigmatic Fluffy.Lumpy Rib is placed on his front with his legs splayed outwards. I touch the jowls that surround his face. Under the soft white fur, the skin is tough and leathery, and would shield his neck from a rival's unsheathed, horn-coloured claws. Morphet tells me the thick skin can blunt his needles.After finding no evidence for a microchip, which would identify Lumpy Rib as someone's beloved pet, Morphet takes some blood samples that will be tested for diseases. Calicivirus (a flu-like ailment) and conjunctivitis can be suggestive of poor living conditions, but the feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) are of more immediate concern. Not only are they fatal and without cure, they are also highly infectious, so could spread from stray cats to wildcats.It does not take long to determine Lumpy Rib's fate. Morphet decants a small drop of the cat's blood onto something that looks like a white doorbell, but which tests for FIV and FeLV with near-perfect accuracy, then starts the stopwatch on his smartphone. We have to wait ten minutes for the test result.The well-lit operating room is not filled with confidence. The big tom's docile demeanour and the claw marks on his nose �C the principal way viruses spread from male to male �C suggest he might be FIV- or FeLV-positive. If he is indeed a carrier, the team would put him down with a humane injection. Even if he did not pose a threat to the wildcats, life with either virus would soon become unbearable.After the ten-minute mark passes, we all breathe a sigh of relief. Lumpy Rib is healthy. This makes Sneddon and me almost cheer with delight: partly because putting down any animal is unpleasant, but also because big males like this are crucial to the conservation of wildcats."He's our bouncer," says Sneddon. Lumpy Rib will hopefully prevent any females �C both stray and wild �C from having kittens. His presence should also reduce the chance that another male will move into the area, start breeding, and spread disease. If the team were to kill stray cats like Lumpy Rib, others would simply move in and take their place, an unhelpful phenomenon known as the "vacuum effect".Instead, the team takes a bit more time and effort, and neuters the strays before re-releasing them.This "trap-neuter-return" protocol requires a lot of planning and patience, even though the surgery itself only takes a few minutes for males and around half an hour for females, whose ovaries are not easily accessible. Used across the globe since the 1960s, it is a tried-and-tested method to control feral cat populations.In 2014, the Wildcat Haven team succeeded in ridding the 250-square-mile (650 sq km) Scottish peninsula of Ardnamurchan of all its fertile and infectious strays. "[Ardnamurchan] is the only place in Scotland where wildcats can only breed with other wildcats," says Paul O'Donoghue, the director and scientific advisor of the project. All the other cats are neutered and free of disease.The 2017 project has the same ultimate goal, but the scale is unprecedented.A trio of deep lakes �C Loch Ness, Loch Oich and Loch Lochy �C splits the Scottish mainland in two, separating 7,000 sq miles (18,100 sq km) of northern highland wilderness from the dense cities and farmlands of the south. This diagonal line of water lies along an ancient rift valley called the Great Glen. There are only three small land bridges across it. One of them borders Inverness, the "capital of the highlands".To O'Donoghue, the Great Glen is a natural boundary for a wildcat haven spanning north-west Scotland. With every stray that is neutered above this line, the Scottish wildcat's future becomes that little bit more secure. But clearing all of north-west Scotland is a huge task for such a small team, and funding is tight: the volunteers, including Sneddon, work long days with little sleep and only have their expenses paid.O'Donoghue and the rest of the Wildcat Haven team welcome such efforts in the field. But at the same time, they are actively campaigning against another of SWA's priorities."The government action plan has a heavy focus on captive breeding, and there is a license in place to capture wildcats," O'Donoghue says. "We are diametrically opposed to that. We believe that the Scottish wildcat should, and can be, conserved in the wild."The trouble is that so little is known about the overall state of the wildcat population, says David Barclay, the project leader of SWA's captive breeding programme at the Highland Wildlife Park. He says SWA's approach is a necessary contingency plan, a safety net for the wildcats."If there are no viable populations, then by that definition it doesn't matter how much conservation work is done in the field," says Barclay. "Even if you remove all the threats, if there is no population strong enough to build itself back up, [the Scottish wildcat] will go extinct."In 2013, the SWA designated five "priority areas" �C Angus Glens, Strathbogie, Strathpeffer, Strathavon and Northern Strathspey �C where Scottish wildcat populations seem to be healthy, based on auspicious camera trap surveys, local sightings and 43 faecal samples. For now, no cats are to be taken from these areas, but Barclay says that his team plans to capture males and collect their semen. This can be used for artificial insemination in the captive population, making its gene pool more diverse."Outside a priority area, where a wildcat is at high threat from localised extinction, or persecution, or further hybridisation, that's an individual that we want to bring into captivity," says Barclay. If it passes a string of tests to prove it is not a highly domesticated hybrid, or simply unhealthy, "that cat would go into the big off-site breeding enclosure".There are other concerns. Since its inception in 2013, the SWA's methods have come under scrutiny from conservationists and animal welfare organisations."We as an organisation don't shoot cats," says Barclay. "But we want to ensure that the way landowners dispatch a cat in a cage trap, which would be shooting, is the most humane and quickest way possible."Regardless of whether shooting is indeed the most humane method of killing these cats, removing them will probably mean that more cats move into the territorial vacuum left behind. Furthermore, if stray cats are seen as disposable creatures rather than precious tools of conservation, people might stop supporting the more effective catch-neuter-return projects. "It will impact the Scottish wildcat, which is the last thing we want," says O'Donoghue.Barclay says SWA was trying to avoid a population boom in captivity, which would have resulted in "many, many animals with no homes to go to". However, O'Donoghue says that a population boom is exactly what the critically-endangered wildcats need, and that most zoos would bend over backwards for wildcat kittens. "Every single individual counts," he says.At four o'clock in the afternoon, Sneddon and I are invited for a cup of tea by a local woman. She wants to see some camera-trap footage of healthy adult wildcats, stalking through their patchwork of grass, juniper, and gorse. Her face lights up as Sneddon points out the distinctive bushy tail and thick stripes of a wildcat that lives in the neighbouring glen, half an hour's drive away.In some areas where the team has been working, kittens have been reported. Their births do not prove that the populations are viable, but they are a promising sign.After we finish our tea and nearly a whole packet of chocolate fingers, the three of us go for a walk under a blanket of amber clouds that soak up the last rays of the sun. After about 10 minutes of walking through reed beds and thick mud, we find some cat faeces. It lacks the spiralled end of fox poo, so the question is whether this scat was from a stray, a hybrid or a wildcat.Behind the poo is a small island of crumbling dry stone wall, a perfect spot for a cat to scent-mark among the waving reeds. To identify the territory��s owner, Sneddon sticks a piece of wood firmly into the soft ground and attaches a camouflaged camera trap, its lens pointing at an area of the wall that has fallen near to the ground, providing a gateway through the stone.Our host bends down to help him tighten the straps. "I've been waiting for 18 months for this," she tells me. "People think I'm crazy, but we have wildcats here in Caithness. It means the 'Land of the Cats'." Her eyes might be watery because of the cold air that sweeps through the glen, but I suspect otherwise."Poo is conservation gold," Sneddon says later. Without it, he would not know where to place his camera traps and would be (almost literally) shooting in the dark.Later, as we drive back to the big tom's farm in the pitch black, Sneddon meditates on the camera-trap site we just left."That wildcat up there with no clue, completely oblivious that it's part of an endangered species, might die there," he says. "But I'd prefer that than for it to live its last days in a cage."In the farmyard once more, Sneddon says I should release Lumpy Rib from the trap. He may have been neutered, but he is still very heavy and I struggle with the cargo as he sits inside patiently, characteristically unperturbed. With a little encouragement from gravity, he returns to his home, skipping heavily over the muddy puddles. His black-and-white fur blends into the night.They are back, and they are busy"Rewilding" would restore our lost big animalsMany people are convinced that they roam the countryAfter a second rift in the Larsen C ice shelf was discovered, Kelly Grovier looks at how a fracture can expose our deepest fears.In the FrameEach week Kelly Grovier takes a photo from the news and likens it to a great work of art.As a visual statement, the aerial photo of the Larsen C crack is, by definition, incomparable; never before has the world marked the glacial advance of such a sublime and fearsome fracture in its very fabric. Yet the reemergence of the image in the news anticipates the ten-year anniversary of one of the most intriguing and innovative large-scale works in contemporary art �C a work whose power relies for its thought-provoking effect on the peculiar poetry of ruinous rifts. In October 2007, the Colombian-born artist Doris Salcedo unveiled in London an ambitious installation in the cavernous space of Tate Modern��s Turbine Hall �C a piece that split reaction down the middle.Inviting gallery-goers into the otherwise empty and austere interior of the former Bankside Power Station, Salcedo subverted expectations. Rather than offering visitors a hall of temporarily installed sculptures, she orchestrated the contemplation instead of a ragged subterranean breach that appeared to rip open the concrete floor of the structure �C a crevice that extended from one end of the yawning space to the other.Salcedo deepened the mystery of her bold and experimental conceptual work by giving to it the curious title Shibboleth �C a biblical word which, when mispronounced, was said to have exposed the outsider status of individuals. Complicating matters still further, the artist insisted that her work was a comment not on the folly of material ambitions, but on racism �C that deep cultural scar that tears at the foundations of humanity. Placed side-by-side, this week��s photo from Antarctica and the image captured a decade ago of Doris Salcedo��s challenging Shibboleth share both a brutal beauty and a common theme: the brittleness of being.19May12Jun12May02Jun04May04SepTucked away in a small section of a Soviet era air base on the outskirts of Kiev is the flagship aircraft of the legendary Antonov design bureau. A one-off masterpiece of engineering designed and built during the 1980s in the waning days of the USSR.The aircraft, designated the An-225, is the biggest to ever grace the Earth. It��s so large that the length of its cargo hold is longer than the Wright brothers�� first flight, from take-off to landing.In 2016, it spent just three months traversing the globe on two lengthy deployments. The remainder of the time, it sat here at the Gostomel airport, once a top-secret flight testing airfield for Antonov.��When the USSR collapsed, the programme was shut down and the financing was closed as the need for this plane vanished,�� says Galunenko. He first flew the An-225 on 21 December 1988, after over a decade��s service as a Soviet test pilot.Galunenko fondly remembers the bewilderment of first taking the behemoth across the world to visit the United States.The plane is effectively an extension of its little brother, the An-124 ��Ruslan�� �C an aircraft rarely regarded as ��little��, seeing as it��s the largest military transport in the world.From a room adorned with scale models of every aircraft the company has built in its 71-year history, the lead engineer of the An-225 project, Nikolay Kalashnikov, tells BBC Future that he spent his entire professional life working for Antonov. But it was building the Mriya that was the pinnacle of his career.��Today it's hard to tell, but back then it was so impressive. It was just so difficult to imagine that such a big machine can fly,�� says Kalashnikov.Although the An-124 Ruslan was already an impressively sized cargo carrier at that time, Kalashnikov and his team set about modifying the structure to increase its maximum takeoff weight. They added two engines, rows of landing gear, extended the fuselage and redesigned the tail in order to meet the most important requirement, which was to ensure that the Buran space-shuttle and the Energia booster rocket could slide off the plane midflight and take off into space.At that time, the USSR��s space missions were run from what is now southern Kazakhstan, at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. So the AN-225��s mission was to bring the booster rockets from Moscow and ferry the Buran itself to Baikonaur. They calculated that the AN-225 programme would be cheaper than building a freeway across two rivers and through the Urals just to move these parts, says Kalashnikov.Kharchenko believes that the Mriya still has huge potential, despite its age, and it��s not just for its enormous cargo capacity. He thinks there��s still the chance to develop the An-225 into a proper in-air launch platform.��Approximately 90% of the energy of the launch vehicle is spent getting up to an altitude of 10km (6.5 miles) ,�� says the CEO. ��If we take some spacecraft and put it on the Mriya's back and fly it up to a height of 10km, then we can launch it into space from there. From the point of view of cost, the economic benefit is huge if you launch from a height of 10km.��He admits it��s still going to take a little bit of refinement, but Kharchenko believes this is the best direction for his company��s flagship aircraft. And he��s not the only one.In 2016, the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AICC), a Chinese state-owned aerospace and defense company, signed a cooperation agreement with Antonov for the An-225 program. If it goes through as planned, the skies could soon be flooded by a fleet of Chinese built An-225s.��The initial idea and early stage research of the An-225 started in 2009,�� the president of AICC, Zhang Youshengtells BBC Future. ��The official contact with Antonov began in 2011, and then from 2013 to 2016 was the acceleration phase of this project.��The Chinese company isn��t interested in purchasing the existing airworthy An-225. They have spent the past several years studying the feasibility of modernising the only other An-225, an unfinished airframe that has sat inside a hangar at Antonov��s giant corporate campus in downtown Kyiv for the past 30 years. This aircraft, when modernised, could give China a heavy lift capability that surpasses any other nation in the world �C perhaps even greater than that of the US military.Heavy lift is not the only capability they��re after though.��The An-225 can be equipped with spacecraft to high altitude, and can launch commercial satellites at any height below 12,000m,�� Zhang tells the BBC. ��Its launch time is flexible, accurate, and can quickly send the satellite into intended orbit, which greatly reduces launch costs.��The Chinese are aiming to make their way into the lucrative satellite launch industry, which doubled revenue from 2006 to 2015, according to figures provided by AICC.If the plan goes forward, the Mriya will have found new life flying the skies for China��s AICC, but Ukraine will have lost of a small but symbolic part of its aerospace industry. The men who built the plane have mixed feelings about the prospect of losing the programme to the Chinese.��The Chinese want to buy from us this plane and there's no harm in it, but of course no one wants to sell the aircraft,�� says Kalashnikov. ��The Mriya is not separable from Ukraine, it��s like our child, and it��s something our children, and our grandchildren can always be proud of.��A seemingly impossible feat of flyingBiggest aircraft to take to the airThe Soviet giant that still soldiers onIt was a defection that shook the world Infamous for walls and checkpoints that keep people apart, the Palestinian Territories are united by a walking trail tracing the footsteps of Abraham, the father of Islam and Judaism.Shamous is the snappiest of dressers.

That is not a good thing to do��,�� said Rand Murra, whose mother operates a homestay for walkers in the village of Kafr Malik, perched 800m above sea level 25km northeast of the city of Ramallah. ��But when they come here, I like hearing them say, ��We changed our minds, and we saw the bright side.�� That is the most important thing for me.��Over the course of three days, I, a photographer colleague and our guide wove our way south from Nablus to Ras al-Auja through olive groves and peach orchards, up rocky slopes and around field boundaries. Some were cultivated with wheat and other cereals. Others were apparently left fallow, overtaken by wild poppies and purple thorns.Creating the path has not been a walk in the park, quite literally. Masar Ibrahim��s co-ordinating team has worked hard to develop unmarked sections of the route. They��ve had to work around numerous obstacles, like military checkpoints operated variously by the Israel Defence Forces and the Palestinian Authority, where vehicles and travellers undergo ID checks and searches. At Awarta, south of Nablus, for example, walkers must travel an 8km section by car to bypass a major inspection point. When they come here, I like hearing them say, ��We changed our minds, and we saw the bright side.�� Sometimes, what we saw along the way made us want to cry. All the hospitality in the world cannot deter from the sadness that afflicts these lands.We arrived in the village of Duma, 25km southeast of Nablus, at sunset on the first day of our trek. This small community of 3,500 people was ripped apart in 2015 when 18-month-old Ali Dawabsheh and his parents were killed in an arson attack on their simple, low-slung house. The air was still filled with silent sadness.Our guide, Anwar, was from the same clan as the victims, and he showed us the remains of the burnt home. ��I always bring walkers on the Masar Ibrahim to the house. I don��t like coming here, but we have to see it,�� he said, looking at the ground.��When people find out about our Oktoberfest, they are shocked,�� Khoury laughed, explaining plans for Taybeh��s annual version of the famous German beer festival. ��When they find out that I make the beer, they are even more shocked. I��m not your typical ��girly girl��. I drive a forklift. I carry cases of beer. I fight with the truck drivers.��In Kafr Malik, Murra��s mother, Misada Muadi, has fashioned guest accommodation in her family��s elegant three-storey home, where the 100-year-old stone walls are at least half a metre thick and arched windows line the tranquil courtyard.More dresses appeared, in cream and red, which traditionally signifies fertility when worn by a married woman.��You can try them on,�� urged Murra. ��We show these robes to guests when they come. People are inspired and really like them.��And try them we did, to much applause from an audience of Murra��s sisters. We always welcome everyone, whatever their language or their religion or their culture. But despite the fun, it was impossible to forget the conflict in this part of the world. The politics are woven into the land, and we met the people who live them.��We always welcome everyone, whatever their language or their religion or their culture,�� Murra said as she put away her mother��s thobes. ��We like getting to know them, and learning from their cultures and customs.��Ali Abu Khurbesh, Shamous��s father, agreed; he does not care for carving lines between Jews and Arabs, Israelis and Palestinians. ��We work with Jewish people, and we do not make any problems with them. They visit me here; we drink tea together,�� he said.As the wind whipped the sandy hills outside our tent on our final night, we wondered how Shamous will build her own identity, and what walkers on the Masar Ibrahim might see when she is big enough to fit into Murra��s gold shoes.For now, her parents are proud to show their slice of the West Bank to anyone who wants to see.They say comparison is the thief of joy. In a world where even millionaires don��t consider themselves wealthy, is the key to life satisfaction to simply stop lining ourselves up against others?Imagine having a six-figure income, owning at least one home and sitting on a spare $1 million in investable assets. Surely a sign that you��ve ��made it�� and are, by global standards, incredibly rich?Apparently not.So, if millionaires don��t consider themselves wealthy, where does that leave the rest of us? If we��re unlikely to ��feel�� rich, no matter how much we earn, is it really worth aspiring to get there at all?Getting off the treadmillShe says plenty of high earners can��t get off the treadmill, even if they��re aware that their happiness or quality of life has flatlined, because they become too defined by their wealth.This, she explains, is because rich people, just as the less well-off, make upwards comparisons, rating their income, home, investments or possessions against those of even richer friends and colleagues, rather than the rest of the population. High earners can��t get off the treadmill because they become too defined by their wealth It��s a pattern that��s all too familiar with life and career coaches like Pia Webb, who focuses on guiding top-tier managers in Europe. Even in her home country, Sweden, a social democracy famed for work-life balance rather than excess, she says many still fall victim to benchmarking themselves against those in higher income brackets.��Nobody looks up to you because you work a lot in Sweden. But there is still a pressure to keep up with others, to show your wealth in other ways, like going on holidays with your family, having a boat, a summer house,�� she says.Webb asks her clients to reflect on the experiences or items they think they personally need to feel satisfied, rather than striving to keep earning more to match societal or peer-group expectations.��When it comes to wealth, many people think money is the key. But you don't need much if you can be happy living in the moment,�� she argues. Webb, who was much more focused on wealth before experiencing a burnout 10 years ago, now enjoys simple pleasures such as having a sauna, taking a walk in the forest or enjoying time with friends and relatives.Happy peasants and miserable millionairesJetten��s research suggests people living in poverty are already accustomed to finding ways to boost their life satisfaction and well-being, that go beyond money and material possessions. They are more likely to spend time with family and volunteer in the community, for instance.��Well-being is related quite strongly to the extent to which there is social capital in a country or society and the extent to which people feel connected to others around them,�� she explains. Wealthier countries are, on average, happier than destitute ones, but after that, the story becomes more complicated ��In developing nations, while much smaller amounts of money can make a huge difference to a person��s lifestyle �C helping them move beyond very basic needs �C those who don��t have much can also be much less frightened of what they��ve got to lose,�� she adds.Carol Graham, professor in the school of public policy at the University of Maryland, has described the paradox as the ��happy peasant and miserable millionaire problem��.��Freedom and democracy make people happy, but they matter less when these goods are less common. People can adapt to tremendous adversity and retain their natural cheerfulness, while they can also have virtually everything�� and be miserable.����In the earthquake a lot of things got destroyed but people were still happy because if they had not lost their family...it could have been a lot worse,�� says the 36-year-old.However Timilsina doesn��t believe his homeland is completely immune to the kind of upwards comparisons that appear to be stressing out the rest of us.��In the city, more educated people are more worried about life. My parents have no money but they are more happy than me,�� he laughs.The future of wealthThough frustrating for millennials, ��it may mean that this generation will show fewer of the negative effects of wealth such as selfishness, narcissism and a high sense of entitlement,�� says Jetten. This generation may show fewer of the negative effects of wealth such as selfishness, narcissism and a high sense of entitlement Paris-based American fashion photographer Eileen Cho, 25, for example, grew up in an affluent neighbourhood in Seattle, but describes the idea of earning cash in order to save or invest it in property as ��like a jail sentence��.Despite being offered financial help from her parents, who wanted to help her buy a home, she��s opted to share a 30-square metre rented apartment with her boyfriend instead.��We pay 950 euro ($1030) a month [in rent] and still have enough for one international trip a month,�� she explains.��For me it��s about experiencing things and being happy. Tomorrow I am off to Spain; my next trip is Marrakech.��It��s an approach that coach Pia Webb supports, although she argues that young workers should be mindful to avoid travel and other experience-based adventures simply becoming the new norm against which they benchmark their ��wealth��.��Travelling is a great way of learning about other cultures, getting to know yourself and finding your place in the world, but it can also become an addiction. You��re getting hit from experiencing new things - just like when people go shopping for example. But this can mean you��re not so rooted, or you miss out on quality time with family,�� she says.��My best advice is that you need to work out what��s right for you as an individual and learn to be happy with the really small things in life, wherever you are��.The surprising reason no amount of money will keep you away from work for longThere��s a little-known downside to becoming richCreate an accountShopping ListWe��ve pulled together our most popular recipes, our latest additions and our editor��s picks, so there��s sure to be something tempting for you to try.Find out what to eat when with our calendar of seasonal produce.Get inspiration and advice for feeding a family.Subscribe to BBC Good Food magazine and get triple-tested recipes delivered to your door, every month.BBC Good Food is ready for summer with these 5 fruity twists on the classic scone recipe.

The death was a tragedy for his parents, Reg and Maggie, but their decision to donate his organs caused organ donation rates in Italy to triple in a decade - a result dubbed the "Nicholas effect". "The first time I sensed danger was when a dark car came up close behind us and stayed there for a few moments," says Reg Green, who is remembering the night his son was inexplicably shot by strangers in southern Italy. "Shortly after, this car began to overtake. I relaxed, thinking there was nothing wrong after all."But, instead of overtaking, the car drew alongside. Reg and Maggie heard loud angry cries. They assumed that the men inside wanted them to stop."I thought if we did stop we would be completely at their mercy. So instead I accelerated. They did too, so the two cars raced alongside each other through the night. A bullet shattered the back window. Maggie turned around and both the children appeared to be fast asleep."In fact, Nicholas had been shot in the head although his sister Eleanor was sleeping peacefully. Seconds later, the driver's window was blown in too and the other car drove off. "I stopped the car and got out. The interior light came on but Nicholas didn't move. I looked closer and saw his tongue was sticking out slightly and there was a trace of vomit on his chin," says Green, 88, whose book about the experience, The Nicholas Effect, formed the basis for the 1998 film starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Alan Bates, Nicholas' Gift. "For the first time we realised something terrible had happened. The shock of seeing him like that was the bleakest moment I've ever had."An American family's holiday had turned into a nightmare. Nicholas died in hospital days later, after entering a coma. But before he did, his parents made a decision which would change the lives of seven families across Italy - they decided to donate his organs. "At that point, these people were just abstractions. You had no idea what kind of people they were. It was like giving money to charity but you've no idea how it helps. Four months afterwards, we were invited to go back and meet them all in Sicily, where four of the recipients are from," says Green.Criminals in Italy rarely kill children, Green says, because it makes the police so determined to catch the killers. This is what happened in Nicholas's case. A no-holds-barred police investigation resulted in the arrest and conviction of two men, Francesco Mesiano and Michele Iannello.It's still unclear whether the men were robbers, or hitmen who attacked the wrong car in a case of mistaken identity, but the fact that one of them employs one of Italy's top lawyers suggests to Green that they have mafia connections."The killing of a seven-year-old American boy in a country where violent death is commonplace has plunged Italy into national soul-searching," the Times reported. Green says that the idea of an innocent child being shot while on holiday in the country made many Italians feel ashamed - and led them to embrace the idea of organ donation as a way of making amends."The work we have done to remind them of how much good could come out of this has had this quite astonishing effect which we couldn't possibly have foreseen. A country that was almost at the bottom for organ donation in Europe could immediately move almost to the top. No other country has tripled organ donation."In 1993, the year before Nicholas was shot, 6.2 people per million donated an organ, while by 2006 the figure had reached 20 per million. During that period, in 1999, Italy moved to an opt-out system, where when someone dies it is presumed they are willing for their organs to be donated unless they have specified otherwise. France, Greece, Portugal and Spain also use an opt-out system, while the US and UK (with the exception of Wales) continue to operate an opt-in system.In Italy, there are more than 120 places named in Nicholas's honour:"Nicholas was a kindly boy who always looked for the best in things so, when you were with him, you always wanted to be your best," explains his father."I know that at seven years old he probably wouldn't have been able to comprehend but, I know, as he grew up this is just what he would have wanted us to do - there's no doubt about that."If the choice was between being angry at the people who did it and wanting to help somebody else as the first priority, he would have undoubtedly chosen helping somebody out."Green, who worked as a journalist on Fleet Street for many years before moving to the US, says his son taught him a lot about tolerance. "I'm impatient and when things go wrong, I get het up about it," he says. "Nicholas had a calmness about it all and a forgivingness that made you want to be the same."Nothing could have prepared Green for the moment he came face-to-face with those people whose lives were saved by Nicholas's organs."When the doors opened and the six walked in, the effect was overwhelming," he says, noting that illness prevented one from being present. "Some were smiling, some were tearful, others were bashful but they were all alive. Most of these people had been on the point of death. That's when it hit you for the first time, just how big a thing this was. "There was also a sense of how the parents and grandparents would have been devastated. You got the feeling there were many more people involved whose lives would have been much poorer if we hadn't saved them."Green and his wife Maggie, who married in April 1986, were keen to ensure that Eleanor did not grow up alone. They have since had twins, Laura and Martin, who will turn 21 in May.  What impact has the death of Green's son had on his life? "There's a sadness that was never there before. I'm never completely happy any more," Green says. "Even when I'm at my happiest, I think: 'Wouldn't it be better if Nicholas was here?'"Green returns to Italy twice a year to raise awareness about organ donation. On his most recent visit he met Maria Pia Pedala, who had been in a coma from liver failure on the day Nicholas died, but quickly bounced back to health after receiving his liver. She married two years later, and two years after that gave birth to a baby boy - named Nicholas - who was followed in two years by a girl, Alessia. The three of them travelled from Sicily, where organ donation was almost unknown in 1994 Green says, to take part with him in a television programme in Milan.Green points out that even the recipient of Nicholas's heart, Andrea Mongiardo, who died earlier this year, had the organ three times longer than Nicholas himself did.But he sees his son's legacy extending far beyond the seven people who received Nicholas's organs. Because donation rates soared after Nicholas's death, he says, thousands of people are now alive who would otherwise have died.Follow Harry Low on TwitterThe abduction of 276 girls in 2014 sparked a global outcry and the #BringBackOurGirls campaign.

But is it safe?Samantha Firth, a 21-year-old nanny living in Chicago, walks to the subway with her friend. So far, so ordinary.But she is simultaneously broadcasting her 15-minute journey live via her mobile to thousands of avid followers."You guys are lit," she says excitedly as she looks at the stream of rolling messages and emojis that are popping up on her screen from her fans. "I love you... you guys are the best," she exclaims, before heading onto the subway and zooming the camera in on a spot on her forehead.It used to be that only film stars would be famous, but thanks to reality TV, YouTube and bloggers, anyone can have their "fifteen minutes" of fame, as Andy Warhol predicted.The proliferation of live broadcasting tools, pioneered by Meerkat several years ago and followed by the likes of Periscope, Facebook, YouTube and others, has given many young people the chance to broadcast every aspect of their lives - whether they're brushing their hair in their bedroom or out dancing with friends.And in the US, 63% of 18-34 year-olds are watching live content and 42% creating it, finds a study by UBS Evidence Lab. But for many like Ms Firth, this isn't just narcissistic fun, it's a cash cow.She joined Live.me - owned by China's Cheetah Mobile - eight months ago after moving from Sydney to Chicago. The live-in nanny has since become one of the most popular broadcasters on the site, amassing 350,000 fans. "Coming from a different country it has been difficult to make friends, but this app has allowed me to connect with people who have the same interests," she says of her reasons for joining. "I spend most of my free time broadcasting because it's where most of my friends are." She is keen to portray a candid version of herself, pimples and all. "I don't wear make-up, I wear sweatshirts and sweatpants," she says. "Sometimes I cry when someone says something hurtful on a broadcast."Like Live.me, live streaming platform YouNow enables these citizen broadcasters to make money from fans sending them virtual gifts. Fans of some streaming sites can also subscribe monthly to their favourite live streamers.Singer Emma McGann, 26, broadcasts live from her studio in Coventry, England, for three to six hours every day. She says her live streams attract about 5-10,000 unique views. "It enabled me to get a single in the iTunes chart," she says. "It's also a great testing ground for new material." "I like the live element. I like to interact with the audience and take song requests."Fans can also speak to her over the internet.While many brands are already running their own live streaming sessions, We Are Social head of strategy Harvey Cossell believes there are opportunities for brands to capitalise on live streaming by co-creating with individuals who have already amassed a loyal audience.The success of such collaborations in the social gaming world, on sites such as Twitch, are a case in point."They would need to identify those people that represent a similar set of values to the brand in question and then find creative ways to partner with them in the production of their content," he advises. The challenge, he warns, is one of authenticity. "It's always better for brands either to partner with the right person, or do nothing at all."But for all its engagement value and monetisation potential, you only have to search online to see that live streaming has its dark side. "Live streaming apps and sites can expose young people to graphic and distressing content and can leave them vulnerable to bullying and online harassment," an NSPCC [National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children] spokesman tells the BBC."Worryingly, live chat can also be used by groomers to target young people who may be manipulated into sending sexual images and videos."Khudor Annous, head of marketing and partnerships at Live.me, says the company has a number of safeguards, including a facial recognition tool that can supposedly spot anyone who's under the age of 13 on the app. "If they are in fact under the age of 13, then we ban the account," says Mr Annous."We have also provided users with reporting tools to report a channel if they identify a child in the app. We're typically able to evaluate reports within a couple of hours depending on daily volume."As for grooming, he says: "Every user has the ability to report any suspicious behaviour before, or any violations of our community guidelines. We also work with the FBI and local law enforcement agencies around the globe to ensure the safety of our community."But there are also concerns that the broadcasters are themselves exploiting young people. Clinical psychologist Linda Blair describes the rise of young people live streaming as "very sad". She adds: "It's an indication of loneliness. They might temporarily feel great but it's only a distraction."But with millions of people already using live streaming platforms, including Facebook Live, we can expect the number of everyday broadcasters to continue growing. "I see live streaming following a path similar to social networking, where at first it started as a place for people to connect with each other but eventually evolved into a powerful platform for advertising, marketing, and publishing," says Paul Verna, principal analyst at eMarketer.Mr Cossell also believes that live video will expand into other formats."It will begin to harness emerging technologies such as 360-video and virtual reality more readily," he says."Live streaming is clearly here to stay."

The father told her to kill it, but instead she hid it and raised it as her own. Two years later, the same thing happened again - and before long she was forced to flee to save the children's lives.Zainab was used to delivering babies. As a traditional birth attendant in rural western Kenya, she'd delivered dozens over the years. But none like the one in front of her now. It had been a tricky birth, but nothing Zainab couldn't handle. The umbilical cord had got twisted around the baby's head and she'd had to think quickly, using a wooden spoon to untangle it. After clearing the baby's airway, she washed the child and cut and tied the umbilical cord. It was then that Zainab saw something she'd never seen before. "When I looked to see if it was a boy or a girl, I saw two things protruding - this baby had male and female parts," she says. Instead of saying what she usually said at this point - "It's a boy!" or "It's a girl!" - Zainab handed the baby to its mother and simply told her, "Here is your baby." When the exhausted mother saw that her child's sex was unclear, she was stunned. But when her husband arrived, he was in no doubt about what should happen next. "He told me, 'We can't take this baby home. We want this baby to be killed.' I told him that the child was God's creation and must not be killed. But he insisted. So eventually I told him, 'Leave the baby with me, I'll kill it for you.' But I did not kill the baby. I kept it."The father came back several times to check that Zainab had done what she'd promised. She hid the baby and insisted she had killed it. But this would not work forever. "A year later, the parents somehow heard that their baby was alive and came to see me," Zainab says. "They told me I must never reveal that the baby was theirs. I agreed and since then I've been raising the child as my own." It was an extraordinary - and risky - choice. In Zainab's community, and in many others in Kenya, an intersex baby is seen as a bad omen, bringing a curse upon its family and neighbours. By adopting the child, Zainab flouted traditional beliefs and risked being blamed for any misfortune.That was in 2012. But two years later Zainab was amazed to deliver a second intersex baby.Although there are no reliable statistics on how many Kenyans are intersex, doctors believe the rate is the same as in other countries - about 1.7% of the population. "This time, the parents didn't ask me to kill the child. The mother was alone and she just fled and left me with the baby," Zainab says.Once again, she took the baby into her home and raised it as part of her family. But her husband - a fisherman on Lake Victoria - was not happy. "When he went out to the lake to fish and had a bad catch, he blamed the children," says Zainab."He said it was because they had brought a curse on us. He suggested I hand the children over to him so he could drown them in the lake. But I refused. I told him I would never allow that to happen. He became violent and we started fighting all the time."Zainab became so worried by her husband's behaviour that she decided to leave him and take the children with her."It was a difficult choice for me because financially I had a comfortable life with my husband and we had grown-up children together and even grandchildren. But you can't live in such an environment - with threats and fighting. I was forced to flee."Childbirth is changing in Kenya. Increasingly, mothers are giving birth in hospitals, rather than in the village. But not so long ago the use of traditional birth attendants was the norm, and there was a tacit assumption about how to deal with intersex babies. "They used to kill them," explains Seline Okiki, chairperson of the Ten Beloved Sisters, a group of traditional birth attendants, also from western Kenya. "If an intersex baby was born, automatically it was seen as a curse and that baby was not allowed to live. It was expected that the traditional birth attendant would kill the child and tell the mother her baby was stillborn."In the Luo language, there was even a euphemism for how the baby was killed. Traditional birth attendants would say that they had "broken the sweet potato". This meant they had used a hard sweet potato to damage the baby's delicate skull. "The parents did not get any say in the matter," says the group secretary Anjeline Naloh. "The expectation was that the baby should not even live long enough to cry."  These days, the Ten Beloved Sisters leave delivering babies to hospital midwives. Instead, they support expectant and new mothers and raise awareness about HIV transmission. But in more remote areas, where hospitals are hard to reach, traditional birth attendants still deliver babies the old-fashioned way and the Ten Beloved Sisters believe infanticide still happens.  "It is hidden. Not open as it was before," says Anjeline Naloh. "Those things still happen, but they are secrets now," agrees Seline Okiki."People bathe openly and if you see something that is a little different, that's where they go speak: 'Oh, did you see something, eh?' [laughter]. You compare. That's normal!"Georgina Adhiambo, executive director of the charity Voices of Women in Western Kenya, which is making efforts to reduce the stigma that surrounds intersex people in western Kenya, says the subject is still taboo."We've come across parents who've tried to hide their intersex child or even locked them up - some because they were ashamed, others because they were afraid that others might try to harm their child," she says."We're explaining who intersex people really are. This is a very religious society, so we explain that intersex children are also created by God." But paediatric endocrinologist Joyce Mbogo - one of a new generation of doctors trained specifically to deal with what they call Disorders of Sex Development, or DSDs - says attitudes to intersex people are starting to change. "We have a new set of parents who are willing to seek help," she says. "The internet is accessible even in the rural areas, so when they realise there's something wrong they're able to look and see what could this possibly be." Treatment options vary. Some patients require no treatment, many need medication or hormone therapy and others need corrective surgery - though often this is delayed until after puberty so the children can decide for themselves who they want to be. For Zainab's adoptive children, such decisions are a long way off. They are healthy and happy and when she talks about them her face lights up. She's visibly proud of them and the new life she's built for herself. She still delivers babies when she's needed, but makes her living mostly by buying and selling clothes and sandals."We all eat well and I can see that they are normal children. We talk, the older one helps with the household chores and my son thinks of them both as his siblings. They are all my family. It's a miracle from God." When asked if she's ever regretted her decision, Zainab laughs as if it's a ridiculous question. "Should I throw them out? No, I'm their mum! They're human beings and I have to take care of God's creation."Illustrations by Charlotte EdeyShare this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowRide-sharing firm Uber is facing a criminal investigation by the US government. The scrutiny has started because the firm is accused of using "secret" software that let it operate in regions where it was banned or restricted.The software, called "greyball", helped it identify officials seeking to stop the service running. It is claimed greyball was used in several areas, including Portland, Oregon, where the ride service was still seeking official approval to operate. In those areas, transport regulation officials posed as passengers in a bid to prove that the company was operating illegally. Greyball worked out who the officials were and blocked them from booking rides with the company's drivers. In a letter sent last week to transport regulators in Portland, Uber said it used the greyball software "exceedingly sparingly" in the city and had not used it since April 2015 when it was granted permission to operate. Uber's use of the software was revealed by the New York Times earlier this year. Uber defended its use in a blog saying the software helped it work out if a ride request was legitimate. It helped Uber limit fraud and protect drivers from harm, it added.It is not clear what sanctions Uber will face if the investigation finds that it did act illegally. The criminal inquiry comes at a difficult time for Uber which has faced criticism on many fronts. It is currently fighting a lawsuit from Google-backed self-driving car firm Waymo. The abduction of 276 girls in 2014 sparked a global outcry and the #BringBackOurGirls campaign.

Some 37 of the 43 regions of the UK are in breach of NO2 limits. Exasperated by what they believed was government foot-dragging on the question of cleaner air, environmental lawyers ClientEarth mounted a legal challenge to force faster action.The series of documents on a clean air strategy released on Friday cover a wide variety of options. The most radical measure being considered is what's termed a "targeted" car scrappage scheme. In its technical documents supporting the plan, modellers estimate that such a scheme could take 15,000 diesel and older petrol cars off the road. The suggestion is that a scheme could be brought in within two years.The move has been applauded by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders"SMMT welcomes the publication of the government's proposals for improving air quality across the UK, which clearly states that the new Euro 6 diesels which have been on sale for the past two years will not face any penalty charges anywhere in the UK," said Mike Hawes, SMMT Chief Executive."We're encouraged that plans to improve traffic flow and congestion, as well as increase uptake of electric and hybrid vehicles, will be prioritised in towns and cities. We look forward to working with government to encourage the uptake of the latest, low emission vehicles, regardless of fuel type."Roger Harrabin, BBC Environment AnalystOpposition parties are furious at the timing of the announcement. Last week the government argued in court that it shouldn't release its report during the election period because it wouldn't get enough public attention. Yet it's published the document today in the shadow of the local election results. The government's two previous announcements on air pollution were slipped out on the Saturday before Christmas, and on the day Jeremy Corbyn became leader of the Labour Party.So why so hush-hush? Well, ministers are trying to serve two sets of voters: parents who don't want their children breathing toxic air, and diesel drivers who don't want to be penalised for buying their vehicles in good faith.One key question will be how much money the government is willing to throw at the problem to encourage cleaner technology.ClientEarth, which brought the court case against the government, says part of the solution is to make diesel car manufacturers play their part - because they deceived ministers and the public into thinking their products were clean."Improving air quality is a key priority as we support businesses in building a stronger and cleaner economy," said Andrea Leadsom, the secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs. "Our plan today sets out how we will do just that - including presenting options for targeted diesel scrappage schemes." However, the ClientEarth lawyers were dismissive of the scrappage plan, saying there was no firm commitment."The government appears to have done some technical analysis of how this might work, and has given vague costings," said Anna Heslop. "But it gives scant reference to a scrappage scheme in the actual plan and there is no commitment to it." The consultation document also looks at the idea of retrofitting buses, trucks and black cabs with devices that would limit their emissions of NO2. While the document does not give a total number, the government highlights the fact that 40 cities and towns are expected to persistently exceed safe NO2 limits.Councils will be given the power to impose fines or restrictions on all polluting vehicles in these areas but the government is strongly of the view that other measures, such as the removal of speed bumps, should be investigated before charges are applied. Political opponents were not impressed with the consultation."This is a weak plan that lacks any sense of urgency," said London Mayor, Sadiq Khan. "That means thousands of people will continue to die prematurely and unnecessarily, and many more children having to live with long-term health problems."The Liberal Democrats were equally pessimistic about the proposals."This is not a plan, it's a cop out," said their former energy and climate change secretary Ed Davey. "Instead of bold commitments to improve air quality, the government is hiding behind yet another consultation and passing the buck to local authorities."The Green party also lambasted the plan."The government is standing idly by while Britain chokes," said co-leader Caroline Lucas. "This feeble plan won't go anywhere near far enough in tackling this public health emergency. "We needed a huge investment in public transport, serious taxation changes and a new Clean Air Act - but none of these solutions are in the plan."The draft proposals will be out for consultation for six weeks while the final plan will be published by the end of July.Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morningThe abduction of 276 girls in 2014 sparked a global outcry and the #BringBackOurGirls campaign.

Models will need to provide a doctor's certificate attesting to their overall physical health, with special regard to their body mass index (BMI) - a measure of weight in relation to height.The health ministry says the aim is to fight eating disorders and inaccessible ideals of beauty.Digitally altered photos will also have to be labelled from 1 October.A previous version of the bill had suggested a minimum BMI for models, prompting protests from modelling agencies in France. "Exposing young people to normative and unrealistic images of bodies leads to a sense of self-depreciation and poor self-esteem that can impact health-related behaviour," said France's Minister of Social Affairs and Health, Marisol Touraine, in a statement on Friday, French media report.France is not the first country to legislate on underweight models - Italy, Spain and Israel have all done so.Anorexia affects between 30,000 to 40,000 people in France, 90% of whom are women.The abduction of 276 girls in 2014 sparked a global outcry and the #BringBackOurGirls campaign.

Prices are still around their lowest level since November, when the Opec oil producers' group agreed to cut output. Investors are worried that Opec nations will fail to rein in output further at their next meeting later this month.The price of US crude also dropped sharply on Friday morning, but then recovered to stand at $46.28 a barrel.Oil prices are down by about 15% since the start of the year, despite Opec's agreement in November which cut output by 1.8 million barrels a day. Supply is still outpacing demand, with US oil production alone up by 10% since summer 2016.It now pumps out some 9.3 million barrels a day - not far short of the two giant oil producing nations of Russia and Saudi Arabia. Opec's deal in November, and subsequent supply cuts agreed by other oil producing countries, helped to boost prices earlier this year, said David Hunter, an energy industry analyst with Schneider Electric. But the market has been "jittery" as countries decide whether to extend those cuts, he said.Opec and other oil nations are meeting on 25 May where they will discuss the success of the six-month cutback and whether it should be deepened. Russia, one of the non-Opec countries to sign up to the cuts, gave mixed signals on Thursday about whether it would continue."While the cartel is expected to extend a self-imposed production cap by another six months, it will be a challenge to convince several non-Opec members to follow suit," said Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy's Global Gas Analytics. "Persistent growth in US oil production ... will also make extensions of the Opec cap beyond 2017 unlikely."  Data released on Tuesday indicated US crude stocks fell 930,000 barrels last week. Analysts had been expecting a drop of 2.3 million barrels. The abduction of 276 girls in 2014 sparked a global outcry and the #BringBackOurGirls campaign.

And let's not forget a stellar cast that includes Andrew Garfield, Denise Gough, Nathan Lane and Russell Tovey.After weeks of previews, the play officially opened at the National Theatre in London on Thursday. Spider-Man star Garfield told us after the show:  "You don't often get to work on a character like this or on a story that has so much humanity in it."It's the whole human experience in one seven and a half hour play. No one would turn that opportunity down."Here are eight reasons why Angels in America is such a heavenly show.On Thursday, both parts of the play played back to back - and lasted seven hours and 32 minutes. Part one - titled Millennium Approaches - kicked off at 13:00, but it wasn't until after 23:00 that the second part - Perestroika - had reached its emotional climax.But it never dragged. Much of the interval chat was about how quickly it seemed to go.   The cast may disagree. Speaking after the show, Russell Tovey admitted: "On a two-show day, it's insane. It's like a 12-hour Zumba class!"The way the play is broken up gives it an episodic feel. Each part has two 15-minute intervals.That makes watching the play feel a bit like you are working your way through a TV box-set. With plenty of loo and coffee breaks. The ex-Spider-Man is unforgettable as Prior Walter, a man who discovers he has Aids and is then abandoned by his boyfriend Louis Ironside (James McArdle). We see him early on as an elegant drag queen, later he's a spectral hooded figure dressed top to toe in black. In the harrowing hospital scenes, he can switch from rage to despair in the course of a single line. Back in January, Garfield found out about his Oscar nomination for Hacksaw Ridge while he was starting rehearsals for Angels in America.It would be astonishing if he's not nominated for more awards for this performance. Nathan Lane plays foul-mouth lawyer Roy Cohn who is in denial about his sexuality.  Told by his doctor that he has Aids, he storms: "No. Aids is what homosexuals have. I have liver cancer." Tovey plays Joe Pitt, a closeted gay Mormon Republican whose Valium-addicted wife Harper is played with gusto by the Olivier-winning Denise Gough.McArdle is excellent as Prior's tormented lover, as is Nathan Stewart-Jarrett as hospital nurse Belize. With more than 30 characters in this play, all of the main cast play multiple parts and it's fun to try and spot them under the costume changes.Marianne Elliott is the award-winning talent behind the National Theatre's West End hits War Horse and The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time.Enough said.  The story begins quite modestly, with a simple revolving set showing us how the lives of the main characters connect.  Later it all goes much larger scale and a lot more surreal. We get a fantasy Antarctica - complete with falling snow - and a neon ladder that ascends to a heaven filled with angels. Yet many of the most memorable scenes are the intimate ones where Prior Walter and lawyer Roy Cohn are sick in their hospital beds and visited by both the living and the dead. Angels in America had its British premiere at the National Theatre in 1992 (with a cast that included James Bond actor Daniel Craig).  The play is set in New York in the mid-1980s when Ronald Reagan was starting his second term as president and the world was in the grip of the Aids crisis.While there is much that is upsetting, Kushner's script is packed with zinging comedy lines. "It's very funny," said Garfield after the show.  "You need to laugh to keep from crying in a situation as devastating as these characters  are going through. "It was amazing putting it in front of an audience for the first time because we were all surprised how funny it was."On the first preview it was shocking how many times we had to stop for the audience laughing."  You won't forget Amanda Lawrence's Angel in a hurry. She crashes dramatically through Prior's apartment ceiling on massive wings that are operated - War Horse style - by six people. She flies, she swoops and she even has sex with Prior. Little wonder he later introduces himself to Harper Pitt as "an angel-ologist".Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes is at the Lyttelton Theatre until 19 August.The abduction of 276 girls in 2014 sparked a global outcry and the #BringBackOurGirls campaign.

In Selfridges' vast accessories hall in London, you can buy a clip-on set of metal flowers from Louis Vuitton, multi-coloured jangling robots from Prada, and leather tassels at Ted Baker.What customers want, it seems, is a way to stamp a bit of individuality on their purchases. And one new counter at Selfridges will let you go a stage further.At Mon Purse, an Australian brand, you are handed an iPad and samples of leathers, and given the chance to design your own handbag."I was looking around for the perfect handbag and I just couldn't find it," explains Lana Hopkins, 33, the company's founder. "And I was quite heartbroken, you know?"Wandering through a Sydney shopping mall one day in 2014, Ms Hopkins stumbled upon Build-A-Bear, a shop where you can assemble your own cuddly toy with some limited variables such as fur, colour and clothing. Although Ms Hopkins was rather older than the average customer, she found creating a teddy for her nephew gave her an extra emotional connection to the product. And the idea for Mon Purse was born. Skip forward three years and Mon Purse now has eight outlets in Australia, three in the UK and two in the US, including a newly opened concession in Bloomingdales, San Francisco.The handbag industry is the latest retail sector to wake up to the possibilities of allowing customers to design their own product.And with people now increasingly used to having things their own way, be it configuring their own music playlists or choosing their exact sandwich fillings, industry insiders say demand for personally designed handbags is soaring."I've never seen a cultural shift like this in the marketplace, and it's giving me whiplash," says Frank Zambrelli, co-founder of 1 Atelier, a New York-based handbag company.To avoid the sky-high prices of a fully bespoke service, which would see customers be able to follow their every whim, most design-your-own handbag firms - such as Mon Purse - instead use the "mass customisation" business model.This means that customers can design their own handbag, but only from a combination of set styles, sizes, colours and materials.So while Mon Purse promises billions of possible variations, in practice the choice is limited to 19 different bag shapes in 35 different colours.This, however, is typically substantially more customisation than offered by established bag-makers. While brands such as Gucci, Coach and Longchamp allow customers to change some elements, the business model of the larger firms still revolves around placing large orders for a design that their in-house team predict will be popular.The new wave of small companies set up to deliver customisation flip that model on its head.Mon Purse uses a visualisation tool based on 3D gaming technology, through which the customer can select size, leather texture, the type of metalwork, and shade of lining. The bag then takes approximately two to four weeks to manufacture.Launched just seven months ago, 1 Atelier allows customers to combine colours from a carefully selected palette for the body, side panels, straps and pockets of 10 different bag designs.But if in the past buying something unique meant a price tag to match, now you can actually make the tailor-made item for less than the mass-manufactured equivalent, according to Mr Zambrelli, who was previously a designer at Chanel."Because we're not putting together a collection based on some inspiration and hopes that we've got the trend right, we're not placing any inventory buys," he says.In other words, they will never be left with unsold stock, which he says more than compensates for not having the economies of scale of a large order. However, prices at 1 Atelier do still range from $295 to $7,380, depending upon the materials and size of bag chosen by the customer.For a significantly cheaper personally designed handbag, Indian company Toteteca will sell you one for between $25 and $40. It makes its bags from polyvinyl, choosing not to use leather for what it says are ethical reasons."You'd be amazed how inexpensive it is to make custom-made bags," says Kushal Chudiwala, the 31-year-old founder of the Mumbai-based business.Perhaps thanks to the low prices, Toteteca seems to free up customers' creativity. While 70% of Mon Purse's customised orders are still a version of a black bag, Toteteca's customers are more adventurous."We don't make many black bags," says Mr Chudiwala.  But they do sometimes feel the need to rein in customers' wilder ideas, he says. "When we first launched, we had a customer select a combination that looked like a handbag for a joker, green and yellow and pink all mixed into one product," he says. When queried the customer stuck to their design, so Toteteca went ahead and made the bag.At 1 Atelier, Mr Zambrelli was initially "hell-bent" on configuring its design tool so that choosing one element would limit the subsequent options, avoiding the possibility of a customer "creating something absolutely hideous that we wouldn't want our name on," he says.But in the end they decided against it."And I'm so glad we did that, because, shame on me, my eyes have been opened up," says Mr Zambrelli."Many people have put together combinations of materials and colours that as a designer for 25 years were anathema to me. And I was 100% wrong. I'm ashamed actually at how narrow my vision was of what works." But 1 Atelier, Mon Purse and Toteteca's founders do all agree that there is such a thing as too much choice - that customers can feel baffled and overwhelmed without some guidance, or narrowing down of the options.Mon Purse's next step will be to offer an algorithm-based design service, to those "feeling a little lost"."We can tap into your Facebook [photos] and see what your favourite colours, textures and designs are, and say you might like A, B and C," says Ms Hopkins.But ultimately, if you lack an inner accessories designer, and your Facebook account doesn't provide inspiration, the safe option remains available - a nice, plain, black bag.The BBC is not responsible for the content of external Internet sites        Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMichael Ignatieff is not a person you would expect to find at the centre of a global political power play featuring names such as Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin.He was the rangy intellectual presenter on late night TV arts shows of the early 1990s in the UK, who looked like he might moonlight in an experimental jazz band.The author and academic entered politics in his native Canada, becoming leader of the opposition party, before last autumn taking on a job as president of the Central European University in Hungary.Mr Ignatieff, in his late sixties, might have been forgiven for thinking that this was a job before retirement - but instead he has stepped into a political storm.The Budapest university has become a symbolic battleground between liberal internationalism and a rising tide of populist nationalism - with loud protests that the Hungarian government is trying to close it down. Mr Ignatieff says it would be the first time a post-War European state had "got away with shutting down a free university"."That's what makes it unprecedented. That's what makes it shocking."Now that's crossing a line. We haven't been there before."We see absolutely no reason why we should be forced out of Budapest, we think it's outrageous," says the university president, speaking in London."We're a free institution, and this is about a drive to control," says Mr Ignatieff.The Hungarian government has insisted this is not the case and the university has only to fall in line with new higher education regulations.And over the weekend, there were signs that Hungary's ruling Fidesz party would bow to pressure from the European Parliament's centre-right grouping to protect "basic freedoms".But this is a dispute with deep roots - not least in relation to the role of the university's funder, George Soros.The Budapest-born billionaire and Holocaust survivor has been a prominent backer of liberal causes. And Mr Ignatieff says Hungary's Prime Minister, Viktor Orban, has had a "longstanding vendetta" against Mr Soros.Mr Orban, in turn, told the European Parliament last week that it was Mr Soros who was the aggressor against Hungary.Mr Soros has other feuds running. He has called US President Donald Trump a "con man and would-be dictator" and has become a hate figure for some of the US president's supporters.He has also been a vocal opponent of Russian leader Vladimir Putin.And at the weekend, demonstrators in Budapest were chanting: "Europe, not Moscow," fearing that the push against the university was part of a move to look eastwards rather than west.Adding spice to the antagonism is the fact that Mr Orban's early career was helped by a grant from George Soros in the late-1980s, bringing him to study in Oxford. The young student who wrote about civil society and the transition to democracy is now the prime minister facing street protests.And there have been some who have seen this all as a proxy struggle between a liberal establishment and the supporters of Mr Trump, Mr Putin and Mr Orban.In the French presidential elections, Emmanuel Macron is accusing his opponent, Marine le Pen, of being part of an alliance with Mr Orban and Mr Putin.The Central European University (CEU) is a liberal, international institution, accredited in the US as well as Hungary, and created to promote democratic values after the end of Soviet rule.Mr Ignatieff was speaking at the University of East London, about projects that both universities run to support refugees - another position unlikely to win friends with those hostile to immigration.But the CEU president says it has been a major miscalculation to believe that the Trump presidency would line up against the university."I think one of the assumptions that Mr Orban must have made is that if he squashed an American institution, the Trump administration wouldn't care -  because it's associated with liberalism and all these hated things."In fact the American administration has been extremely forthright, right out of the gate."The dispute over the university has continued to ripple outwards - with a surrounding digital blizzard of claim, counter-claim and fake news.The European Commission has launched proceedings against Hungary, with vice-president Frans Timmermans saying the country's new rules on higher education were "perceived by many as an attempt to close down the Central European University".A collection of European scientists has written to Mr Orban to say moves against the university were "totally at odds with what we thought was taken for granted in free democracies".But Mr Orban's reply showed no sign of changing direction.He wrote back that the scientists' claims do not "correspond with reality" and there had been "false allegations" and an "international disinformation campaign" against Hungary's government.So what happens next?Until anything else is confirmed, Mr Ignatieff says that from October the university's licence can be withdrawn and they will be unable to recruit students."We're not going to shut down, but we may have to leave the country."And he says that they have received offers from six other countries to take the university.But he is still campaigning to stay in Budapest - and not wanting to burn any bridges, emphasises that there is no political challenge to Mr Orban."This is not fascism. This is a populist democrat, he won a free and fair election. In Budapest, you're not in the deep freeze of Communist Hungary or fascist Germany."Mr Ignatieff also says the hand of Mr Putin shouldn't be seen everywhere: "We invest in Putin powers that he can only dream of. We pump the guy up bigger than he actually is."But this is a line in the sand, says Mr Ignatieff. If universities can be shut down in the heart of Europe, then what does it mean for the future of democracy?"Democracy is not just majority rule, it's not just free media, it's not just a free judiciary. It's about institutions that have the right to govern themselves," he says."This is a battle for something I really care about, this is really deep in me. "Universities are infuriating, they're difficult. But if you want a democracy, you want free institutions. It's really important." "This is one I couldn't afford to miss and one I can't afford to lose."Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowFrom her base in Caracas, Venezuela, Meridith Kohut has been documenting Latin American life since 2007.

Sunday's election is seen as the most important in France for decades, with two diametrically opposed views of Europe and France's place in the world at stake. The National Front's Le Pen would close borders and quit the euro currency, while independent Macron, who has never held elected office, wants closer European cooperation and an open economy.Certain religious leaders are rejoicing in their new freedom to preach their views, while others fear the change will erode the integrity of houses of worship.President Trump declared Friday that everybody on the world stage has better health care than the United States, but suggested that the GOPs health care plan will change that.

I would have made it an issue with the Office of General Counsel, the office of security and the office of counterintelligence  absolutely.Flynns failure to disclose his payments from RT, the Russian government-funded TV network that U.S. officials say serves as a propaganda arm for President Vladimir Putins administration, erupted as an issue earlier in the day Thursday when it was revealed that the Department of Defenses top watchdog is investigating whether Flynn, President Trumps former national security adviser, violated federal ethics rules by failing to report and receive prior approval to accept the RT fees.General Flynn provided two briefings to the Department  one before and one after the event. The Department was fully aware of the trip, Kelners statement continued. We urge DIA and the Committee to release the full, unredacted letter, along with the documents that General Flynn provided to DIA during the briefings and details concerning the in-person briefings provided by General Flynn to DIA.The disclosure by Defense Department Acting Inspector General Glenn Fine, in a letter to Congress, is the first indication that Flynns Russia ties are now being investigated by a federal agency. It is also prompting mounting charges from congressional Democrats that the White House is stonewalling inquiries into Flynn in order to deflect attention from questions about alleged ties between the Trump campaign and Moscow.Other documents released by Cummings on Thursday include a letter from a DIA lawyer warning Flynn in October 2014  after he was fired as the agencys director  that he was prohibited from receiving payments from foreign sources without advance permission.The letter from the lawyer, whose name is redacted, seems clear-cut. It advises Flynn of multiple ethics rules that would continue to govern his postmilitary conduct, including a ban on all retired military personnel from receiving foreign governments emoluments  defined as any consulting fees, gifts, travel expenses, honoraria or salary C without receiving prior consent from Congress and their previous service secretary.Accordingly, if you are ever in a position where you would receive an emolument from a foreign government or from an entity that might be controlled by a foreign government, be sure to obtain advance approval from the Army prior to acceptance, the letter reads. It later states: You are respectfully reminded that you are responsible for ensuring compliance with these post-government restrictions, noting that these statutes carry criminal sanctions.But another new DIA letter released by Cummings on Thursday states that the agency could locate no documents showing that Flynn sought advance permission or approval for the receipt of money from RT.We have no evidence, not a shred, that he disclosed his payments, Cummings said at a news conference about Flynns payments from RT.I didnt take any money from Russia, if thats what youre asking me, Flynn said at first. Then, when asked who did him pay him, Flynn replied: My speakers bureau  ask them.That failure has now apparently led to the Pentagon investigation.This office has initiated an investigation to determine whether Lieutenant General (LTG) Flynn, U.S. Army (Retired) failed to obtain required approval prior to receiving any emolument from a foreign government, Fine, the acting Pentagon inspector general, wrote in a letter to Chaffetz dated April 11 and released Thursday. Fines letter cites some of the same ethics restrictions that Flynn was warned about by the DIA lawyer in 2014.Read more from Yahoo News:Update (2:50 p.m. ET): With comments from Kelner and Wise.114President Trump declared Friday that everybody on the world stage has better health care than the United States, but suggested that the GOPs health care plan will change that.

Go ahead and take the Wall Street money if you want, but at least make the case that underlies it.Its tricky to navigate, this business of being an ex-president. We now have five formers running around out there like characters from Night at the Museum, and three of them left office well before their 60th birthday. Its not an easy thing to figure out how to exist meaningfully in the world for a quarter century or more after youve already reached historys pinnacle, all the while trying to uphold your lifestyle, enhance your legacy and stay out of your successors way.The youngest ex-president in history, Teddy Roosevelt, was 50 when he left office, and four years later, after a brief disappearance to Africa, he was running for the office again. (He died at 60.) Harry Truman, who left the White House at 68, lived off a meager Army pension and some cobbled-together money from book sales and land deals; its because of him that presidents now get lifetime stipends and funding for their libraries.If theres one theme that seems to run through most modern post-presidencies, though, its a kind of atonement, or at least an acknowledgment of regret. Jimmy Carter started this, really, transforming himself into a tireless elder statesman after having feebly presided over an economic and global unraveling.Obama isnt really the type to spend a lot of time indulging what-ifs, and his essential failure as president is harder to pinpoint. You could say his legacy is marred by not having managed to elect his chosen successor, but really, he didnt have a whole lot to do with that.You could argue, credibly, that Obama left the world less stable than he found it, or the economy more bifurcated. But here he confronted larger currents that were hard, if not impossible, for any administration to divert. Historians wont punish him for coming up short.This is obviously most pronounced on the conservative side, where a dark, xenophobic strain of populist fury expanded its hold during the Obama years, waiting to be exploited by a consummate opportunist like Donald Trump.But the anti-globalism tremor isnt strictly a conservative phenomenon. Although liberals wouldnt like to see it this way, their own populist revolt  which took hold after the economic collapse of 2008 and is now personified by the oldsters Warren and Sanders  overlaps with Trumpism in significant ways.The resurgent left, too, reflexively castigates financiers and free trade, offering up the well-worn and simplistic idea that taxes and tariffs  along with yet more federal spending  will somehow take the economy back to its industrial apex.Obama knows better. He fought valiantly for his Trans-Pacific Partnership, a major gambit to establish Americas economic dominance in Asia. (The populist left applauded Trump when he pulled the plug on that.) Behind the scenes, Obama sought a comprehensive budget deal that would have slowed the growth of government programs and reduced deficits.Obama successfully pushed to rein in the excesses of Wall Street, but he resisted calls for putative measures like breaking up banks, which is probably why he raised more money from the financial sector than any other presidential candidate in history.And yet, rather than openly confront the reactionary movement in his own party, Obama repeatedly tried to co-opt it. He murmured insincere indictments of the fat cats on Wall Street and ran a reelection campaign that sometimes seemed only about raising taxes on the rich  a manifestly worthy idea, but hardly the basis for an economic policy.What you can see now, though, stepping back from it all, is that Obamas inherent reticence emboldened a wave of retro politics in his own party, the effects of which may not be fully realized until 2020. Its increasingly a populist party, arrayed against Obamas globalist vision, organized around social justice on one hand and economic vengeance on the other.If Obamas goal is to get even wealthier than he already is, then he should advance the out-of-fashion idea that wealth in itself isnt the enemy of progress. Nostalgia and demagoguery are.That would be a true profile in courage, even if half the audience didnt applaud._____Read more from Yahoo News:114
